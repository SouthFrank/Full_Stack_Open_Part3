# Part 3 Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express
- This section was added to its own dedicated git repository, with source code right at the root of the repository, to avoid future complications with later stages of Part 3.

## Exercise 3.1
- Implement a Node application that returns a hardcoded list of phonebook entries from the address http://localhost:3001/api/persons.

Status: *completed*

## Exercise 3.2
- Implement a page at the address http://localhost:3001/info that looks roughly like the presented image.
- The page has to show the time that request was received and how many entries are in the phonebook at the time of processing the request.
- There can only be one response.send() statement in an Express app route. Once you send a response to the client using response.send(), the request-response cycle is complete and not further can be sent.
- To include a line space in the output, use <br/> tag, or wrap the statements in <p> tags.
